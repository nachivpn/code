# code

The purpose of this repository is to study and develop a personalised code of ethics for my participation in academia. I hope to use the contents of this repository as a reference for my own conduct and my expectation in interacting with others. I will develop this repository over time (possibly _years_), as I continue to learn from my experiences, and of those around me, in academia. While I may start out somewhat sloppy and disorganised, I expect things here to take shape with time.
